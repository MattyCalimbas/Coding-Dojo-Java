# Task Manager(Coding Dojo Java Project)

This a Coding Dojo project where under a 5 hour time constraint I created a fully functional web application that lets a user create a task managing system.  A user registers, logs in and views added content on a dashboard web page with tasks presented in a table format with pertinant information displayed such as importance. This web application also sports full CRUD implementation with its ability to also edit and delete uploaded user data.  This web application also sports full MySQL database integration for login/registration and user data submissions.
