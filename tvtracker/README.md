# T.V. Tracker (Coding Dojo Java Project)

This a Coding Dojo project where under a 5 hour time constraint I created a fully functional web application that lets a user create a simple tracking system for their favorite television shows.  A user registers, logs in and views added content on a dashboard web page.  This web application also sports full CRUD implementation with its ability to also edit and delete uploaded user data.  This web application also sports full MySQL database integration for login/registration and user data submissions.
