# Event Planner (Coding Dojo Java Project)

This a Coding Dojo project where under a 5 hour time constraint I created a fully functional web application that lets a user upload planned events, the location, and displays pertinent information to the user logged on such as events within his state, event outside of the state of residence all filtered by whether or not the user is an attendee.  This web application also sports a full fledged user login/registation and CRUD operational system implemented via a MySQL database.
