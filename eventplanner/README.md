# Event Planner (Coding Dojo Java Project)

This a Coding Dojo project where under a 5 hour time constraint I created a fully functional web application that lets a user upload planned events and its location.  This web application also displays pertinent information to the user logged on such as events within his state, events outside of the state of residence and any events planned by the user. All relevant data is filtered by whether or not the user is an event planner or an event attendee.  This web application also sports a full fledged user login/registation and CRUD operational system implemented via a MySQL database.
